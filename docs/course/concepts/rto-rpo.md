# Concept: RTO and RPO

> **Implementation status:** `implemented`
> **Status boundary:** One local clean-restore drill measured 21.586 s RTO and zero record change at the snapshot boundary; these observations are not production objectives or guarantees.
> **Reviewed revision:** `3577b00` (documentation review; runtime evidence links may name their own revision)
> **Used by modules:** [Module 14](../modules/14-local-operations/README.md)
> **Catalog ID:** `rto-rpo`

## Beginner explanation

RTO is how long recovery may take; RPO is how much recent data may be lost. Objectives are targets, while observed results are measurements. **It is not:** One cached-image developer-machine run does not establish an SLO.

## Prerequisites and vocabulary

### Learn first

- [Agent anatomy](agent-anatomy.md) — separates runtime decisions from tools and evidence.
- [Policy engine](policy-engine.md) — explains fail-closed action control.
- [Run Ledger](run-ledger.md) — explains durable evidence versus transient signals.

### Vocabulary

| Term | Plain-English meaning | Related concept |
|---|---|---|
| boundary | The point where input is validated and authority is limited. | [Policy engine](policy-engine.md) |
| scope | Identity/project/resource dimensions that constrain an operation. | [Authorization and ownership](authorization-ownership.md) |
| evidence | Inspectable record supporting a specific, bounded claim. | [Run Ledger](run-ledger.md) |

## Problem and mental model

RTO is the recovery stopwatch; RPO is the rewind distance. Inputs cross a validation boundary; outputs are bounded outcomes plus evidence. Important invariants are explicit scope, finite resources, sanitized failures, and no authority inferred from untrusted payloads.

## Architecture and components

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Caller --> V[Validate identity, scope, schema]
  V --> C[RTO and RPO boundary]
  C --> E[(redacted evidence)]
  C -. bounded failure .-> E
```

| Component | Role | Out of scope |
|---|---|---|
| API/runtime boundary | Validates request and binds trusted context. | Trusting caller-supplied ownership. |
| `local DR smoke` | Implements the central contract. | Production guarantees beyond its wired path. |
| Evidence path | Records safe status and identifiers. | Raw secrets, prompts, or chain-of-thought. |

## Startup sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Config
  participant App
  participant Component
  participant Dependency
  Config->>App: validated settings
  App->>Component: construct/inject
  Component->>Dependency: initialize or health-check
  alt required dependency fails
    Dependency-->>App: fail startup/readiness
  else ready
    Dependency-->>App: bounded capability
  end
```

Configuration and dependencies become authority only through application construction; user payloads cannot create deployment-owned capabilities.

## Per-request sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Caller
  participant Boundary
  participant Core as local DR smoke
  participant Evidence
  Caller->>Boundary: authenticated, bounded request
  Boundary->>Core: owner-bound validated input
  alt accepted
    Core->>Evidence: safe event/status/measurement
    Core-->>Caller: typed result
  else denied, invalid, timeout, or dependency failure
    Core->>Evidence: stable sanitized failure
    Core-->>Caller: bounded error
  end
```

## Class and dependency view

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Boundary
  class Core {
    +local DR smoke()
  }
  class EvidenceSink
  Boundary --> Core
  Core --> EvidenceSink
```

Archon uses composition and injected dependencies; this diagram does not imply inheritance.

## State and lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Configured
  Configured --> Active: validated request
  Active --> Complete: bounded success
  Active --> Failed: denied/invalid/timeout/dependency error
  Complete --> [*]
  Failed --> [*]
```

Persistent state, when applicable, is owner-scoped; transient telemetry never silently becomes authorization state.

## Archon implementation and source walkthrough

### Source symbols

| Source symbol | Role | Status boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [`scripts/local-dr-smoke.sh:local DR smoke`](../../../scripts/local-dr-smoke.sh) | Central implemented behavior. | Inspect call sites before extending the claim. |
| [`app.main:lifespan`](../../../backend/app/main.py) | Constructs application-scoped services and readiness dependencies. | Presence at startup is not public deployment. |

### Tests

| Test | Contract proved | Not proved |
|---|---|---|
| [`backend/tests/unit/test_local_dr.py`](../../../backend/tests/unit/test_local_dr.py) | Deterministic contract for the listed implementation. | External-provider parity, load, public deployment, or SLOs. |

### Runtime evidence

| Evidence | Claim supported | Revision/environment/limit |
|---|---|---|
| [Implementation evidence](../../IMPLEMENTATION-EVIDENCE.md) | Separates exists, wired, tested, observed, UI, and deployed. | Local/test evidence; mutable status source. |
| [Architecture diagrams](../../ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAMS.md) | Current wider system context. | Read with the evidence matrix. |

## Try it: command or bounded exercise

### Goal

Confirm the contract without external credentials.

### Setup and safety

From repository root; `uv` and backend dependencies are required. Tests use fixtures/local dependencies and should not receive real secrets.

### Steps

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest -q tests/unit/test_local_dr.py
```

Then locate `local DR smoke` in `scripts/local-dr-smoke.sh` and write one sentence naming what the test proves and one sentence naming what it cannot prove.

### Done criteria

- [ ] The focused test passes and its assertion is identified.
- [ ] The result is tied to `local DR smoke`, not merely to a file.
- [ ] No external credential, service, or persistent lab data was introduced.

## Security and failure modes

| Threat/failure | Control or boundary | Failure behavior | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Malformed/unbounded input | Typed validation, schema and finite budgets | Reject or stable bounded error | New formats require new validation. |
| Dependency timeout/cancellation | Deadline and explicit cleanup path where wired | Failure is observable; no invented success | End-to-end deadlines are path-specific. |
| Cross-owner access/concurrency | Authenticated scope and atomic/idempotent storage where applicable | Owner-scoped miss/denial or guarded update | Audit all new queries and side effects. |
| Secret/PII leakage | Redaction before operational persistence/log rendering | Sanitized metadata, not raw exception text | Redaction is defense-in-depth, not certification. |
| Resource exhaustion | Count/byte/time limits and rate limits | Fail closed or stop with evidence | Local measurements do not establish capacity. |

## Observability and evidence path

```text
authenticated input → scoped decision/state → redacted runtime event → Run Ledger/log → metric/trace/UI → evaluation
```

Use correlation ID and run ID, stable reason codes, counters and spans. Never log raw credentials, provider exceptions, hidden reasoning, or tool payloads merely to make debugging easier.

## Alternatives and trade-offs

| Alternative | Benefit | Cost/risk | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Implicit/unbounded behavior | Less setup | Authority and failures become unauditable | Rejected. |
| Deterministic local contract tests | Fast and reproducible | Cannot establish provider or production behavior | Used for contract proof. |
| Managed production service | Scale/operations features | Cost, external trust and deployment work | Deferred unless directly evidenced. |

## Lab vs production

| Dimension | Demonstrated | Unverified, partial, or deferred |
|---|---|---|
| Wiring | Real repository path invokes the listed symbol. | Every historical/alternate path and future change. |
| Testing/observation | Focused automated test and linked local evidence. | External providers, sustained traffic, multi-host scale. |
| Security | Scope, validation, bounded failures and redaction. | Independent audit, rotation program and threat-model signoff. |
| Operations | Reproducible local target where relevant. | Public deployment, hosted SLOs and on-call operation. |

Status is **implemented** within the stated boundary. Local Compose is not deployment; one verifier child is not a swarm; runtime feedback is not generic self-reflection.

## Interview answer

### 30-second answer

> RTO is how long recovery may take; RPO is how much recent data may be lost. Objectives are targets, while observed results are measurements. In Archon the boundary is `local DR smoke`; `backend/tests/unit/test_local_dr.py` exercises its contract. The honest limit is: One local clean-restore drill measured 21.586 s RTO and zero record change at the snapshot boundary; these observations are not production objectives or guarantees.

### Follow-up prompts

- Why is this boundary safer than trusting caller/model output?
- Which identifier or budget prevents authority from expanding?
- What failure is recorded and where?
- What would need direct evidence before claiming production readiness?

## Self-check

1. Define RTO and RPO without naming an Archon class.
2. What nearby concept must not be conflated with it?
3. Trace configuration and one request through the diagram.
4. Which symbol and test provide the strongest contract evidence?
5. How are malformed input, ownership, secrets, and exhaustion handled?
6. What is demonstrated locally and what remains unverified?

1. RTO is how long recovery may take; RPO is how much recent data may be lost. Objectives are targets, while observed results are measurements.
2. One cached-image developer-machine run does not establish an SLO.
3. Settings construct the component; authenticated scoped input is validated; success or a stable failure emits safe evidence.
4. `scripts/local-dr-smoke.sh:local DR smoke` and `backend/tests/unit/test_local_dr.py`.
5. Typed bounds, owner scope, redaction, deadlines/rate limits, and fail-closed errors; new paths still need review.
6. The source/test/local evidence establish the stated boundary, not public deployment, provider parity, scale, or an SLO.
